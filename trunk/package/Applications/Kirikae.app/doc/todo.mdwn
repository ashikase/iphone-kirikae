> * Add controls for iPod/Pandora/Other application.
>     * This is beyond the purpose of Kirikae, and would only lead to further such requests, causing code bloat and maintenance nightmares.
> * Support for triple-tapping to invoke.
>     * Some people have said that even double-tapping is difficult to use. While SpringBoard does now provide methods for triple-tapping in the latest firmware (3.1.*), it is not available in firmware 3.0, which many still use.
> * Support for swiping/touching the screen to invoke.
>     * The only practical space to use would be the status-bar, which is already used by other popular extensions. Anything outside of the status-bar would interfere with the current application.
