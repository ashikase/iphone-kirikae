> ## (These will not be implemented)
> - - -
> * Add controls for iPod/Pandora/Other application.
>     * This is beyond the purpose of Kirikae, and would only lead to further such requests, causing code bloat and maintenance nightmares.
> * Support for triple-tapping to invoke.
>     * Some people have said that even double-tapping is difficult to use. The simple fact is that SpringBoard does not provide built-in support for triple-tap (it does for double-tap).
> * Support for swiping/touching the screen to invoke.
>     * The only practical space to use would be the status-bar, which is already used by other popular extensions. Anything outside of the status-bar would interfere with the current application.
